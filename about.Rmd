I’m Bailey Meche—data scientist and economist (MACSS-Econ, UChicago).  
My work sits at the intersection of **quant finance**, **macro**, and **large-scale data systems**.

**Focus areas**
- Treasury markets, arbitrage, market frictions  
- Reproducible research: R/Python, Quarto/Rmd, CI/CD  
- HPC + cloud workflows (Midway3, AWS, GCP)
